September 09, 2024 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.6 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.6

This release contains relatively few changes compared to the previous one,
but they include important bug fixes, such as:

- Fix resource leak in wxBitmapBundle in some circumstances (#24703).
- Fix crash when using static wx libraries in a Windows DLL (#24730).
- Fix possible crash during drag-and-drop in wxGTK (#24677).
- Fix wxDatePickerCtrl being unusable in some locales in wxGTK (#24533).
- Fix regression in focus handling under macOS 14+ (#24605, #24667).
- Fix regression in wxTranslations introduced in 3.2.3 (#24297).

Other changes include:

- High DPI fixes for wxBitmapComboBox (#24563), wxDataViewCtrl (#24648),
  wxNotebook (#24606), wxPropertyGrid (#24607), wxWizard (#24743).
- Improve wxSlider appearance under macOS (#24532, #24539).
- Correctly use current keyboard layout in key events in wxGTK (#24772).
- Fix handling of ligatures in wxStyledTextCtrl in wxGTK (#13168).


Please see the full change log for more details:

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
